# Berry-Fun
A C# Console Application I created for Programming I at *Full Sail University*.

The game is simple, **collect berries and avoid enemies.** If you get hit by too many enemies, you die and have to restart.

This was my first game with a full gameplay loop. It's pretty generic and simple, but definitely grew my understanding back then, of the C# language, gameplay states, classes, etc. You can also **increment the number of enemies by changing the enemyCount in Program.cs**, though if you add too many enemies, they'll sit still at the start for quite a bit before moving like normal.

The project's name is 'Shadow' as I was hoping to create a stealth like game, though with less than two weeks time and not much prior coding experience, this was what I created in that time frame with a C# Console Application and much research. *Nikhil Prakashbabu* was a partner for the project, though we created two seperate ideas and chose which program we liked more and submited my project for the assignment. He was an awesome friend and still is, rock on man.
