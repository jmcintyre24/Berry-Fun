# Berry-Fun
A C# Console Application I created for Programming I at Full Sail University.
The game is simple, collect berries and avoid enemies. If you get hit by too many enemies, you die and have to restart.

The project's name is 'Shadow' as I was hoping to create a stealth like game, though with less than two weeks time and not much prior coding experience, this was what I created in that time frame with a C# Console Application.
Nikhil Prakashbabu was a partner for the project, though we created two seperate ideas and chose which program we liked more and submited my project for the assignment. He's still an awesome guy and hope he's doing great.
